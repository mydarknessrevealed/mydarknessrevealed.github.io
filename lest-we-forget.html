            <div class="poem-content">
                <p>Memory is a curious, frail, thin thing,<br>
                A haunting melody a bird does sing,<br>
                Fragile as the skein the spider does spin,<br>
                A whisper trapped where dreams begin,<br><br>
                A trace of voices that should never end.<br>
                But not even this is written in stone,<br>
                The wind turns south and it all is gone,<br>
                To recall them, blessings in our winter days,<br><br>
                Lest they were trapped inside a cage.<br>
                Buried beneath the mire, so far down inside the deep,<br>
                Within the Id, they still call home,<br>
                Begging solemnly, “Do not forget.”<br><br>
                The ghost that lingers on the page.<br>
                What was once your youth is now your age.<br>
                Through tangled strands of time we weave,<br>
                Reliving moments we once believed.<br><br>
                In the frost of years unknown,<br>
                We plead their echoes still be sown.<br>
                Entombed beneath the drowning mire,<br>
                Within the Id, they call—expire,<br><br>
                Murmuring soft, “Do not forget.”<br>
                A phantom inked on pages set,<br>
                What once was dawn is now regret.<br>
                All is now lost within our age.<br>
