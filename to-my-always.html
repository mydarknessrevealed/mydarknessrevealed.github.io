                <p>“To My Always”<br>
                In the whispers of the wind,<br>
                I hear your name—<br>
                not spoken, but sung,<br>
                a melody etched in the threads of my soul.<br>
                The river remembers us,<br>
                its waters carrying the echoes<br>
                of laughter and tears,<br>
                of stolen glances and promises<br>
                we never stopped meaning.<br>
                Time tried to scatter us,<br>
                to erase the lines we drew in the sand,<br>
                but love—<br>
                our love—<br>
                is the tide that returns,<br>
                smoothing every scar.<br>
                I saw you first in a mayfly storm,<br>
                your eyes the only light I’ve ever needed.<br>
                Do you remember, Sabrina?<br>
                When the world stood still,<br>
                and the air between us danced<br>
                with the weight of eternity?<br>
                Every moment since has been chasing that—<br>
                that feeling, that truth.<br>
                And when I found you again,<br>
                it wasn’t chance.<br>
                It was gravity pulling home<br>
                what was always meant to be whole.<br>
                You are the stars in my night,<br>
                the fire in my winter,<br>
                the dream that never fades.<br>
                And though the years have tried to bury us,<br>
                I still stand, digging, unearthing,<br>
                finding you in every corner of my heart.<br>
