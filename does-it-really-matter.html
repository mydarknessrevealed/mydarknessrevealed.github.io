                <p>Mad as a hatter,<br>
                Mercury slipping through my fingers—<br>
                Liquid silver, toxic, elusive.<br><br>
                Does it matter<br>
                If the insanity lingers?<br><br>
                Did you see that?<br>
                ...Did I?<br><br>
                What happens if we both look at the same time?<br>
                No, you're crazy, I'm fine.<br>
                I'm always on time, never late—<br>
                WHO LOCKED THE FUCKING GATE?!<br><br>
                I’m sorry—<br>
                Let me reiterate.<br>
                Sigh.<br><br>
                Okay. Now, where were we?<br>
                No, no, no, that’s all wrong—<br>
                Were you even paying attention?<br><br>
                Oh, by the way—did I forget to mention?<br>
                You are only a figment of my imagination.<br><br>
                Yet here we are, dancing on the edge of reason.<br>
                Going mad, if only for a season.<br><br>
                If that were true, then you wouldn't see me, and I wouldn't be you.<br><br>
                But am I?<br><br>
                I SAID, WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING!?<br><br>
                Am I?<br><br>
                I apologize. I promised I would keep my composure until this was all over, so let us continue, shall we?<br>
                Where were we by the way? I’m sorry. I wasn’t paying attention.<br><br>
                For the sake of argument, let’s say we exist<br>
                Somewhere between logic and madness,<br>
                Between a whisper and a scream, the ego and the id.<br>
                Blink—and I vanish.<br>
                Wake—and it was only a dream.<br>
                Could it ever be that simple?<br>
                Isn’t that all we were wanting? Just a moment of peace.<br><br>
                Yet the walls still breathe when I turn away.<br>
                You speak in circles but have nothing to say.<br>
                That incessant dripping—taunting.<br>
                That tick-tick-tock—haunting.<br><br>
                Did we do this already?<br>
                Déjà vu like a record skipping in my head.<br>
                The needle digs deep into my skin,<br>
                But ink spills where blood should’ve been.<br>
                Stanzas tattooed themselves into my veins,<br>
                Scrawling words I half remember, half invent.<br><br>
                They say madness is just seeing too much.<br>
                Hearing too well.<br>
                Feeling too deep.<br><br>
                So tell me my friend—who decides reality?<br><br>
                Your reflection lingers too long in the mirror.<br>
                And I wonder:<br>
                Who’s the real one standing here?<br>
                And as I realize it may not be me,<br>
                Something cold curls ‘round my spine—<br>
                Fear,<br>
                Quiet and absolute, intimidating, but honest.<br><br>
                Mad as a hatter.<br>
                Mercury slipped through my fingers.<br>
                It always mattered.<br>
                And the insanity lingers.<br>
