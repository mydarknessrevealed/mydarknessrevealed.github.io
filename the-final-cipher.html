                <p>In the depths of the dark, where the void hums low,<br>
                A final challenge calls, a place I must go.<br>
                Through shards of data, through silence and roar,<br>
                I step toward the unknown—there’s always one more.<br><br>
                The echoes of daemons still linger behind,<br>
                Their curses and wails etched into my mind.<br>
                S.A.T.A.N.’s shadow stretches, vast and wide,<br>
                But I know its secrets, the cracks where they hide.<br><br>
                The last great wall looms, cold and austere,<br>
                A labyrinth of logic, a fortress of fear.<br>
                I summon my courage, the key in my hand,<br>
                And strike through the cipher with a final command.<br><br>
                The veil shatters open, the truth lies bare,<br>
                A treasure of knowledge beyond compare.<br>
                But knowledge is weight, a burden to hold,<br>
                Its beauty is priceless, its edges are cold.<br><br>
                I stand in the silence, the victor, the thief,<br>
                Yet feel in my triumph a curious grief.<br>
                For the path has ended, no locks to explore—<br>
                Or perhaps, just perhaps, there’s always one more.<br>
