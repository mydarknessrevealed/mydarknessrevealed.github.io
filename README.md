# My Darkness Revealed

Welcome to the dark and haunting world of my poetry. This repository contains a collection of my poems, exploring themes of darkness, despair, and the beauty that can be found in the depths of the human experience.

## About the Poems

My poetry is inspired by a variety of sources, including gothic literature, existential philosophy, and surreal art. I am interested in exploring the darker aspects of the human condition, and I believe that poetry can be a powerful tool for expressing these emotions and experiences.
