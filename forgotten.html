                <p>I, the lone witness, stand at the precipice, I understand I have a choice.<br>
                Do I give or do I take?<br>
                Do I hope or do I do?<br>
                What about this life is worth it?<br>
                How simple it will be to sit by and let it die with a whimper,<br>
                All the others passing by.<br>
                1x2 the slats are wide enough to see through.<br>
                Cough, choke.<br>
                Do I dare or do I do?<br>
                There's nothing you will ever want that will equal what you dream,<br>
                but a dream is a nightmare behind the scenes.<br>
                To and fro, back and forth, in and out, day and night.<br>
                Again and again until the colors at the end change shape before our eyes<br>
                on the night we lost our minds.<br>
                We held ourselves together with a thread.<br>
                Nothing more, nothing gained, nothing less.<br>
                Everything lost, you see, close your eyes wide.<br>
                Will you ever understand that you can only hear what you say<br>
                with your ears full of mud and your steps mottled, son.<br>
                Try to walk, try to crawl, but you can only run from yourself until you fall.<br>
