                <p>I would lose myself there,<br>
                In a moment that would last forever.<br>
                I'd watch you do the same, too,<br>
                As my dreams became haunted by you.<br><br>
                Where have we been?<br>
                I’ve been lost in your eyes,<br>
                A lifetime erased,<br>
                My dreams, denied,<br>
                All haunted by those eyes.<br><br>
                My doorway into forever—<br>
                And yet, my demise.<br>
                That place I swore I’d never leave,<br>
                Is now the source of all my grief.<br><br>
                Once so beautiful, so inviting,<br>
                That place now feels inscrutable, terrifying—<br>
                Its warmth replaced by shadows and fright,<br>
                The home of my heart, now void of light.<br>
