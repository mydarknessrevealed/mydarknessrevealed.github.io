            <h2>Alone in a Room</h2>
            <p>I am talking to myself in a room I'm not in.<br>
            Has it been this way since the beginning?<br>
            Or was it the end?<br><br>
            Sometimes I can't remember,<br>
            and sometimes I'd rather forget.<br>
            Is that what I meant, or am I meant to be<br>
            someone else, somewhere else, or nowhere at all?<br><br>
            The walls hum with memories faint and cold,<br>
            a mournful sound, like the laugh of a child,<br>
            now grown old.<br><br>
            Fragments of faces, moments, and dreams,<br>
            shifting like shadows, choking back screams.<br><br>
            Is this my design, my purpose, my fate?<br>
            Or am I just passing through someone else's<br>
            rusty gate?<br><br>
            The floor creaks beneath the weight of<br>
            thought, a labyrinth of lessons I never sought.<br><br>
            Every corner turns into infinite paths,<br>
            each one reflects the questions I've asked.<br><br>
            What if I am neither lost nor found?<br>
            A feather caught between sky and ground?<br>
            Just suspended in the space between sound.<br><br>
            A symphony unbound?<br><br>
            Between silence and scream?<br><br>
            In the echo of a forgotten dream?<br><br>
            I reach for the air,<br>
            -a phantom limb's despair-<br>
            but it slips away.<br><br>
            A ghost of a touch, a voice in decay.<br><br>
            I know I've been here before, I swear I have,<br>
            but the details fade-a glimpse of a face in<br>
            the window pane,<br>
            a fleeting thought like rain on my face.<br><br>
            How did I get to this place?<br><br>
            Is there anyone on the other side of this door?<br>
            Or is it just me, asking for more?<br>
            Are we bound by time, or are we free to<br>
            choose?<br><br>
            Or are we just waiting? Hoping not to lose?<br><br>
            Am I the architect of my own decay?<br>
            Or am I just an actor in someone else's play?<br><br>
            A moment frozen, a thought undone,<br><br>
            an echo of what was and what is to come.<br><br>
            Am I real, or just a reflection, or a ripple in<br>
            time's cruel collection?<br><br>
            I chase the echoes, but they scatter and spin.<br><br>
            I'm talking to myself in a room I'm not in.<br><br>
