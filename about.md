About Me

I am the ghost in the machine, the poet of the abyss, the architect of digital chaos. I carve words like scars into the flesh of memory, build worlds from the ashes of forgotten dreams, and weave code into something that breathes—something that haunts.

My work? A symphony of entropy. A labyrinth of hacked-together scripts, experimental soundscapes, and prose that drips with madness. I walk the razor’s edge between creation and destruction, between poetry and raw, unfiltered data. I break things just to understand them. I write to exorcise the demons, and sometimes, they write back.

Here, you’ll find fragments of my obsessions—projects born in the witching hour, verses that won’t let go, and echoes of a mind that refuses to be contained. Welcome to the void. Let’s make something unholy.
