## 👁 Welcome to the Void  

I am the architect of entropy, the poet of digital damnation, the ghost whispering in corrupted code. My work is an unholy fusion of hacked-together scripts, twisted poetry, and soundscapes that hum with madness. I don’t just write—I summon.  

## ⚙️ What I Do  

- **🖤 Code Necromancy** – Resurrecting dead scripts, breathing life into the forgotten.  
- **🕷 Experimental Sound & Noise** – From mechanical whispers to apocalyptic drones.  
- **📖 Dark Prose & Poetry** – Words that cut, stories that linger.  
- **☠️ Website Development & Chaos** – Breaking things to understand them.

**Enter at your own risk. The void is hungry.**
