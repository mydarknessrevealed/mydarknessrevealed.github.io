                <h3>Part I</h3>
                <p>From Hell I have tread with a gift for you,<br>
                It is my heart, it is black and used.<br>
                I've seen pleasures of Heaven and treasures of Hell,<br>
                The only thing I have left are the stories I tell.<br><br>
                They are not enthralling nor well written,<br>
                Leaving a little to be desired, to say the least,<br>
                But at least I have slain the beast.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part II</h3>
                <p>I walk this earth with a jagged breath,<br>
                A soul carved from sorrow, untouched by death.<br>
                The weight of my heart, a burden untold,<br>
                Its story written in ink, but left to grow cold.<br><br>
                With every step, I can feel it tear,<br>
                A piece of me lost, replaced with despair.<br>
                I offer it to you, wrapped in my pain—<br>
                A gift, if you will, from the ashes I’ve gained.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part III</h3>
                <p>What is Hell, if not a reflection of me?<br>
                A mirror of anguish, a shadow set free.<br>
                I’ve danced in the flames, and I’ve drowned in the tears,<br>
                But still, I stand here, consumed by my fears.<br><br>
                You ask me why, and I answer with none,<br>
                For even my demons have nowhere to run.<br>
                Yet I carry on, walking through fire,<br>
                A soul burning slowly, but never to tire.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part IV</h3>
                <p>The world is a cage, but it’s the only one I’ve known,<br>
                A kingdom of dust where I’ve lived alone.<br>
                The sky looks like ash, the stars never burn,<br>
                Each lesson learned, another scar earned.<br><br>
                I’ve been broken and remade, too many times,<br>
                Each crack a poem, each tear a rhyme.<br>
                But I still march forward, with death in my wake,<br>
                A warrior built from the choices I make.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part V</h3>
                <p>Each step echoes louder than the last,<br>
                A drumbeat of pain, of a past long passed.<br>
                The chains I wear are of my own design,<br>
                Forged in the fires, locked in my mind.<br><br>
                I’ve worn my grief like a cloak too tight,<br>
                A shroud of sorrow that swallows the light.<br>
                But I’ll burn it away, piece by piece,<br>
                Until I am nothing, and yet, somehow, released.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part VI</h3>
                <p>In the depths of my soul, a battle unfurls,<br>
                Where angels and demons clash in swirling worlds.<br>
                They tear at my heart, they claw at my mind,<br>
                Leaving me shattered, broken, and blind.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part VII</h3>
                <p>I’ve walked through the fire, I’ve tasted the pain,<br>
                I’ve seen my own darkness, I’ve felt the rain.<br>
                But through it all, I’ve learned to fight,<br>
                To find the strength within the night.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part VIII</h3>
                <p>I’ve learned that demons are not always what they seem,<br>
                They can be the shadows that haunt your every dream.<br>
                But they can also be the fire that burns within,<br>
                The strength that helps you rise and begin again.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part IX</h3>
                <p>I’ve learned that scars are not always a sign of pain,<br>
                They can be the proof that you have overcome the rain.<br>
                They can be the symbol of your strength and your fight,<br>
                A reminder that you have survived the darkest night.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part X</h3>
                <p>I’ve learned that Hell is not a place you go,<br>
                It’s a state of mind, a place you know.<br>
                It’s the darkness within, the pain you hold,<br>
                But it’s also the strength that makes you bold.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part XI</h3>
                <p>For Hell cannot break what it cannot control,<br>
                And though it scars me, it makes me whole.<br>
                I’ll carry these wounds until the end of days,<br>
                For they are my truth, my war, my praise.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part XII</h3>
                <p>The silence is loud, the night is long,<br>
                Yet here I remain, trying to be strong.<br>
                For every tear that’s ever been shed,<br>
                A thousand dreams have risen from the dead.<br><br>
                I’ll take what’s broken and make it whole,<br>
                A journey of pain, but also a goal.<br>
                To rise from the ashes, to walk through the fire,<br>
                To heal from the hurt and to reignite the desire.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Part XIII</h3>
                <p>I’ve learned that peace is a fickle friend,<br>
                And sometimes the battle will never end.<br>
                But each fight brings a lesson, each loss a gain,<br>
                For even in Hell, there’s beauty in pain.<br><br>
                I’ll carry my scars, I’ll wear them with pride,<br>
                For they are the proof that I survived the tide.<br>
                And when the storm is over, I’ll stand tall,<br>
                A soul reborn, having conquered it all.<br><br>
                And so, from Hell, I continue to rise,<br>
                A broken heart, a shattered disguise.<br>
                I’ve walked through the fire, I’ve danced with the flame,<br>
                And now I stand strong, no longer the same.<br><br>
                For I am not just the pain I have known,<br>
                I am the strength I have found, the seeds I’ve sown.<br>
                From Hell I have tread, but I am not undone,<br>
                For the greatest battles are the ones we’ve won.<br>
